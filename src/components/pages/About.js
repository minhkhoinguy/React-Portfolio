          Hi, I'm Minh Khoi Nguyen 🙋‍♂️,living and working in Seattle, Washington.
          I love traveling and explore the world✈️🧳. I'm currently studying at
          UW Coding Bootcamp and looking forward to becoming a web developer in
          the future. I cando full stack developer but I am more confident in my
          font-end. I have been working in F and B industry for 4 years before,
          although that experience is hardly applicable in web development
          industry but it has helped me to be able to communicate with
          clients,good teamwork and work well under high pressure. If you have
          any questions please contact me.
        </p>
